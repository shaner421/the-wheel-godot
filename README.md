Overview:

The WHEEL (Godot Edition) is an open source implementation of the persuasion wheel mechanic from TES4. 
This code is free to use and distribute for the purposes of WHEELJAM and any games you choose to make with it besides. 
Please provide attribution if you use it outside the jam. :)

This code is also not required for WHEELJAM -- you are free to make your own implementation of the wheel, use your own assets, etc.
Everything to make the wheel function is in this folder; including free wheel assets, and a demo of the wheel in action.
